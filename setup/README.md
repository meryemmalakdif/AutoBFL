# Setup 

The `Setup/`directory  contains the initial configuration and installation scripts required to run the infrastructure needed for both layer1 and layer2 experimentations. 
To test the `layer1` setup of our project, you can utilize any Ethereum blockchain client. In our development process, we have specifically tested the contracts using  [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/) (Feel free to explore and verify the functionality of our contract using the Ethereum client that best suits your needs).
