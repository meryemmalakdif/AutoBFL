# Contracts

## Introduction 
The "contract" folder exclusively dedicated to housing the smart contracts that have been meticulously coded using the Solidity programming language. This folder is thoughtfully organized into three distinctive subfolders, each catering to a specific facet of our contract architecture.

## Content  

1.  **Oracle Contract Subfolder**: Within this subfolder, you will discover smart contracts meticulously designed to integrate and interact with an oracle. These contracts enable the seamless integration of external data sources, enhancing the reliability and relevance of our blockchain-based system , visit chainlink documentation for more information about how oracle works . 
    
2.  **Chainlink Token Implementation Subfolder**: Here, you will encounter smart contracts that pertain to the implementation of Chainlink tokens. These contracts play a pivotal role in our system's ecosystem, facilitating the interaction and exchange of tokens while ensuring security and transparency , those tokens are used in chainlink node interactions . 
    
4.  **Proposed Model Implementation Subfolder**: This subfolder contains the embodiment of our proposed model through smart contracts. These contracts encapsulate our unique system architecture, reflecting the innovative ideas and concepts that set our system apart.
    
Collectively, the "contract" folder stands as a testament to our comprehensive approach to contract development. By systematically organizing these contracts into subfolders, we aim to enhance clarity, maintainability while ensuring that our smart contracts are fully aligned with the goals and functionalities of our system.
